QUESTIONS TO ASK THE INTERVIEWER 

LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST, when the interviewer asks you “Do you have any questions for me ?”, make sure you have at least one question ready for him. 

Some interesting questions : 
 
What are your views on <insert some recent feature of the company>. 

I noticed that you use technology X. How do you handle problem Y ? 

Why did the product choose to use the X protocol over the Y protocol ?

How does X work where X is a very small component / piece about a feature ? For example, how does Facebook web chat maintain connections to the server ? Is it long polling behind the screens ? 

How much time do you spend writing code everyday ? 

How do teams discuss new ideas ?
